### The Game
Super Springer is a 3D platformer game created using <b>Unity</b>. The player controls a spring and uses gravity boxes to change orientation to jump on perpendicular and upside down walls. The game also includes enemies: wicked windmills, sinister staple removers and pesky projectile enemies. Collect coins to increase your score. Make your way to the portal to complete a level. Collect hearts to regain health. Falling down and losing all health results in respawning at the last checkpoint lamp. Use the disguise powerup to evade enemies. Fight the boss in Level 3 to win the game.
